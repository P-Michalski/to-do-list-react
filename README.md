# To-do list
Third project made as a part of YouCode course - now remade in React.js. It is a simple web application that allows you to add new tasks, remove them and mark as done.

## Usage (*Note: interactions not yet implemented!*):
You can type yout task in the input box with "Co jest do zrobienia" placeholder. Next, to add the task - you have to click "Dodaj zadanie" button to make your task appear at the bottom of "Lista zadań". You can delete your task, using the red button on the right side of your task or simply mark it as done, using the green button which is on the left. There are also 2 buttons visible, when there is atleast one task added by you. "Ukryj ukończone" button allows you to hide all tasks that are marked as done, using the previously mentioned green button. "Ukończ wszystkie" button on the other hand marks all tasks as done (as if you clicked the green button on each task simultaneously).

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
